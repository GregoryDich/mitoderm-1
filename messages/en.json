      "title": "HOW DO EXOSOMES WORK?",

When applied to a treatment area, they communicate with these cells to promote repair, regeneration, and rejuvenation. By harnessing your body's natural healing processes, exosome therapy stimulates tissue renewal, boosts collagen production, and enhances overall cellular health. The result is significant improvement in the treated area—whether it's skin, hair or other specific regions."
